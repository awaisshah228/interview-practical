    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>How Perplexity Differs:</strong> Instead of generating creative fiction, Perplexity searches the web, synthesizes findings, and cites its sources. Use it to verify trends, find statistics, and ground your video ideas in real data." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>5 Ways to Use Perplexity for Video Ideas:</strong>" },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>1. Trend Validation:</strong> After generating ideas with ChatGPT, use Perplexity to verify whether those topics are actually trending." },
