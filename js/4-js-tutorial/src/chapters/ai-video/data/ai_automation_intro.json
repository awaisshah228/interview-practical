    { "type": "p", "text": "AI video automation is the practice of using software pipelines, APIs, and orchestration platforms to <strong>automatically generate, edit, and publish video content</strong> with minimal human intervention. Instead of manually operating each AI tool, you connect them into workflows that run on their own." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "At its core, automation transforms a multi-step creative process — writing scripts, generating images, synthesizing voiceovers, composing video, adding captions, and uploading — into a single triggerable pipeline that executes every step in sequence." },
    { "type": "note", "text": "Automation does not replace creativity. It removes repetitive manual tasks so you can focus on creative direction, quality assurance, and audience strategy." },
    { "type": "h2", "text": "Why Automate Video Creation?" },
    { "type": "p", "text": "Manual AI video creation works well for one-off projects, but it becomes unsustainable when you need to produce content <strong>consistently at scale</strong>. Automation solves the three biggest bottlenecks: time, consistency, and cost." },

    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>Manual workflow:</strong> Open ChatGPT, write a script, copy it, open Midjourney, generate images one by one, download them, open Runway, upload images, generate clips, download clips, open a video editor, assemble clips, add voiceover, export, open YouTube, upload, fill in metadata. Every step requires your attention." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>Automated workflow:</strong> Trigger a pipeline (via schedule, webhook, or button). The system calls GPT for a script, sends image prompts to Midjourney or DALL-E, passes images to Runway for video generation, synthesizes voiceover via ElevenLabs, assembles everything with FFmpeg or Remotion, and uploads the finished video to YouTube with auto-generated metadata. You review the output." },
    { "type": "note", "text": "Most production workflows use a hybrid approach: automation handles generation and assembly, while a human reviews the final output before publishing. This is called human-in-the-loop automation." },

    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>1. Scalability:</strong> Once a pipeline is built, producing 50 videos costs roughly the same effort as producing one. You scale by adding API calls, not hours." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>2. Consistency:</strong> Every video follows the same template, style guide, and quality standards. Brand identity stays intact across hundreds of pieces of content." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>3. Speed:</strong> A pipeline that takes 8 hours manually can run in under 30 minutes. Overnight batch jobs can produce an entire week of content while you sleep." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>4. Cost Efficiency:</strong> API calls cost pennies compared to hourly labor. A fully automated 60-second video might cost $0.50-$2.00 in API fees versus hours of manual work." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>5. Reproducibility:</strong> Pipelines are versioned and documented. If something works, it works every time. If something breaks, you can trace exactly where and why." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "<strong>6. A/B Testing:</strong> Automation makes it trivial to generate multiple variations of the same video with different thumbnails, titles, hooks, or styles to test what performs best." },
